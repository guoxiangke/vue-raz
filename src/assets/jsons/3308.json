The frog wins any jumping contest--until a trickster arrives, finds a way to defeat the frog, and walks away with the gambler's money and his pride. How does the trickster do it? And will the miner's less-than-enthusiastic listener ever escape his talkative captor?","pageCount":18,"highFrequencyWords":"Use of vocabulary lessons requires a subscription to VocabularyA-Z.com.","reviewWords":"Use the strategy of making, revising, and confirming predictions before and during reading","comprehension":"Colloquial phrases                : Identify and understand the use of colloquial phrases","awareness":"Promote higher-order thinking for small groups <br>or whole class","phonics":"","grammar":"","wordWork":"","pdfName":"raz_lz35_celebratedjumpingfrogofcalaverascounty"}

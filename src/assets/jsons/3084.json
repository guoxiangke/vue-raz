The Recess Revolt tells the story of two students who did just that-they found a way to change the unfair rules at school by applying the lessons they learned from the civil rights movement of the 1960s to their own problems. Colorful illustrations and a relatable plot will keep students engaged in this story, which can also be used to teach problem and solution as well as to make, revise, and confirm predictions. The book and lesson are also available for levels R and X.","count":18,"from":0,"meta":["app, budget, circulate, civil disobedience, civil rights, funding, petition, protests, segregation, signatures, sit-ins, sponsorship","Make, revise, and confirm predictions","Problem and Solution : Identify the problem and solution in the story","Commas : Recognize and use commas to separate dialogue","Hyphenated and Compound Words : Identify and use hyphenated compound words","Promote higher-order thinking for small groups <br>or whole class"],"pdfs":["pdfsite\/3084\/raz_lu26_recessrevolt_wksh.pdf","pdfsite\/3084\/raz_lu26_recessrevolt_wksh_rs.pdf","pdfsite\/3084\/raz_lu26_recessrevolt_wksh_gm.pdf","pdfsite\/3084\/raz_lu26_recessrevolt_wksh_ww.pdf","pdfsite\/discussion\/u\/raz_dclu26_recessrevolt.pdf","pdfsite\/comp_quiz\/u\/raz_cqlu26_recessrevolt.pdf"],"mis":{"clr":"pdfsite\/levels\/u_ds\/raz_lu26_recessrevolt_clr_ds.pdf","lblp":"pdfsite\/3084\/raz_lu26_recessrevolt_lblp.pdf"}}

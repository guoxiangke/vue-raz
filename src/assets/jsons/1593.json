Her family lives in the city, and they don't own a farm, but they do have a chicken coop in their backyard, where they care for three chickens. Savannah's story will defy expectations for many students, who think of chickens living on a farm in green pastures, and they will be fascinated to learn how a girl their age cares for and manages these animals. Family photographs invite students to enter Savannah's world.","count":17,"from":1,"meta":["bedding, chicks, coop, grind, nesting boxes, pellets","Use the reading strategy of summarizing to understand text","Main Idea and Details : Identify main idea and details","Consonant Digraphs : Identify consonant <em>ch<\/em> digraph","Pronouns : Recognize and use pronouns","Bold Print : Understand the purpose of bold print in text","Promote higher-order thinking for small groups <br>or whole class"],"pdfs":["pdfsite\/worksheets\/k\/raz_lk29_chickensinmybackyard_wksh.pdf","pdfsite\/worksheets\/k\/raz_lk29_chickensinmybackyard_wksh_rc.pdf","pdfsite\/worksheets\/k\/raz_lk29_chickensinmybackyard_wksh_ph.pdf","pdfsite\/worksheets\/k\/raz_lk29_chickensinmybackyard_wksh_gm.pdf","pdfsite\/discussion\/k\/raz_dclk29_chickensinmybackyard.pdf","pdfsite\/comp_quiz\/k\/raz_cqlk29_chickensinmybackyard.pdf"],"mis":{"clr":"pdfs\/levels\/k\/raz_lk29_chickensinmybackyard_clr_ds.pdf","lblp":"pdfsite\/lesson_plans\/k\/raz_lk29_chickensinmybackyard_lp.pdf"}}

Students will travel back in time with Prehistoric Giants (Other Than Dinosaurs) to learn about giant reptiles as well as giant species of shellfish, insects, centipedes, fish, amphibians, birds, and mammals. Read about how these animals once were a force to be reckoned with, but are now extinct. Vivid photographs, illustrations, a timeline, and a map support the text as students learn about identifying main ideas and details and using commas in a series. The book and lesson are also available for levels Z1 and Z2.","count":18,"from":0,"meta":["amphibians, arthropod, eras, extinct, habitats, herbivores, ice age, invertebrates, paleontologists, prehistoric, species, tentacles","Ask and answer questions to understand text","Main Idea and Details : Identify main idea and details","Commas : Identify and use commas in a series","Prefixes : Identify the meaning of prefix <i>pre-<\/i>","Promote higher-order thinking for small groups <br>or whole class"],"pdfs":["pdfsite\/nonbooks\/literature_circle_custom_journals\/lcj_y_prehistoric_giants_other_than_dinosaurs.pdf","pdfsite\/2278\/raz_ly30_prehistoricgiants_wksh.pdf","pdfsite\/2278\/raz_ly30_prehistoricgiants_wksh_rs.pdf","pdfsite\/2278\/raz_ly30_prehistoricgiants_wksh_rc.pdf","pdfsite\/2278\/raz_ly30_prehistoricgiants_wksh_gm.pdf","pdfsite\/discussion\/y\/raz_dcly30_prehistoricgiants.pdf","pdfsite\/comp_quiz\/y\/raz_cqly30_prehistoricgiants.pdf"],"mis":{"clr":"pdfs\/levels\/y\/raz_ly30_prehistoricgiants_clr_ds.pdf","lblp":"pdfsite\/2278\/raz_ly30_prehistoricgiant_lblp.pdf"}}

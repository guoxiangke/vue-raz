Pecos Bill was an extremely strong boy who was accidentally separated from his parents at a young age. He was found and raised by coyotes in the wild, where he lived for fifteen years. Eventually, a cowboy found him and brought him to civilization, where Bill outsmarted outlaws from the Wild West and tamed the wildest of horses.

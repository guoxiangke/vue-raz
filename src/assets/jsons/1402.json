She explains that there are many different animals to choose from at a shelter and that they are often healthier than pets that are sold by a breeder or pet store. The book includes information about veterinarians and adoption counselors, and the fees that are collected upon adoption at a shelter are explained. A persuasive last point is made: every time someone adopts from a shelter, he or she saves an animal's life.","count":17,"from":1,"meta":["breeders, counselors, lifestyle, microchip, obedience training, owner, purebred, shelter, veterinarian","Use the reading strategy of asking and answering questions to understand text","Fact or Opinion : Correctly distinguish fact and opinion","Consonant Digraphs : Recognize and read consonant digraphs sh and ch","Conjunctions : Identify subordinating conjunctions","Homographs : Locate and understand homographs","Promote higher-order thinking for small groups <br>or whole class"],"pdfs":["pdfsite\/worksheets\/p\/raz_lp36_shelterpetsarebest_wksh.pdf","pdfsite\/worksheets\/p\/raz_lp36_shelterpetsarebest_wksh_rs.pdf","pdfsite\/worksheets\/p\/raz_lp36_shelterpetsarebest_wksh_rc.pdf","pdfsite\/worksheets\/p\/raz_lp36_shelterpetsarebest_wksh_gm.pdf","pdfsite\/worksheets\/p\/raz_lp36_shelterpetsarebest_wksh_ww.pdf","pdfsite\/discussion\/p\/raz_dclp36_shelterpetsarebest.pdf","pdfsite\/comp_quiz\/p\/raz_cqlp36_shelterpetsarebest.pdf"],"mis":{"clr":"pdfsite\/levels\/p_ds\/raz_lp36_shelterpetsarebest_clr_ds.pdf","lblp":"pdfsite\/lesson_plans\/p\/raz_lp36_shelterpetsarebest_lp.pdf"}}

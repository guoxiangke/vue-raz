Washington was a slave on a plantation in Virginia until he was nine years old. His autobiography offers readers a look into his life as a young child. Simple pleasures, such as eating with a fork, sleeping in a bed, and wearing comfortable clothing, were unavailable to Washington and his family. His brief glimpses into a schoolhouse were all it took to make him long for a chance to study and learn. Readers will enjoy the straightforward and strong voice Washington uses to tell his story.","count":19,"from":1,"meta":["autobiography, big house, Emancipation Proclamation, entangled, flax, manual labor, overseer, paradise, plantation, quarters, scolding, self-reliance, trade, woe","Make connections to prior knowledge to understand the text","Make Inferences : Make inferences and draw conclusions","Complex Sentences : Identify and form complex sentences","Content Vocabulary : Use content vocabulary","Promote higher-order thinking for small groups <br>or whole class"],"pdf":"raz_lx09_upfromslavery"}

Frustrated that she isn't quite a teenager yet, like her sister, she finds herself trying to explain to her family that turning eleven is not what she wants at all. She retreats to her room and decides to follow the advice of her father, who always tells her to \"weigh the facts.\" As she compares ages eleven and sixteen on paper, she realizes that the responsibilities of becoming eleven aren't really that different from sixteen-especially when she renames her age eleventeen.

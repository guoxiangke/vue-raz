Exploring in the woods, they discovered a large hole in the ground and excitedly dug to investigate. They continued to explore the cave until they discovered a dark, cavernous room. The walls were covered with paintings of animals-found later to be created by Stone Age people who lived 17,000 years earlier. Archaeologists began to raise many questions, some of which are still unanswered. Photographs, a map, and illustrations support the text.","pageCount":25,"highFrequencyWords":"accustomed, analyzed, bas-relief, befuddled, cavernous, discovery, exploration, instincts, masterpieces, methods, mysterious, mystical, passage, radiocarbon, scaffold, treasures","reviewWords":"Use of vocabulary lessons requires a subscription to VocabularyA-Z.com.","comprehension":"Commas                : Identify and use commas after introductory words","awareness":"Conjunctions                : Understand the use of conjunctions in the text","phonics":"Promote higher-order thinking for small groups <br>or whole class","grammar":"","wordWork":"","pdfName":"raz_ls26_whatboysfound"}

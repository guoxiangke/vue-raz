Learning about water's changing states of matter is an important concept that most young scientists love to explore. <em>The Icy Tent<\/em> introduces readers to the different states of matter using a unique medium: a play. As Keisha and her father, Mr. Jones, experience the wonders of the great outdoors on a camping trip, they also find examples of the different forms water can take and how they affect their environment. The connections this duo make are ideal for integrating science into literacy and teaching cause-and-effect relationships. Through this informational play, readers are able to practice fluency and learn about science concepts through the use of descriptive text, detailed Illustrations, and graphics. The play can also be used to help students visualize to connect to the text and use colons.","count":18,"from":0,"meta":["condensed, disbelief, distorted, drought, evaporating, exhausted, insulated, moisture, vents","Visualize to understand text","Cause and Effect : Determine cause and effect","Colon : Recognize and use colons","Content Vocabulary : Identify and use content vocabulary","Promote higher-order thinking for small groups <br>or whole class"],"pdfs":["pdfsite\/4173\/raz_lq39_icytent_wksh.pdf","pdfsite\/4173\/raz_lq39_icytent_wksh_rc.pdf","pdfsite\/4173\/raz_lq39_icytent_wksh_gm.pdf","pdfsite\/4173\/raz_lq39_icytent_wksh_ww.pdf","pdfsite\/discussion\/q\/raz_dclq39_icytent.pdf","pdfsite\/comp_quiz\/q\/raz_cqlq39_icytent.pdf"],"mis":{"clr":"pdfsite\/levels\/q_ds\/raz_lq39_icytent_clr_ds.pdf","lblp":"pdfsite\/4173\/raz_lq39_icytent_lblp.pdf"}}

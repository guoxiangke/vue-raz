The books tell the same story--a new version of Jack and the Beanstalk--but a different character narrates each of them. In Jack's Tale, students will learn what Jack is feeling as he embarks on his adventure. This lesson gives students an opportunity to compare different points of view and see how they alter the story and also allows students to make text-to-text connections through the story and illustrations. The new twist on a familiar tale and the surprise ending guarantee student interest.","count":17,"from":1,"meta":["ax, beanstalk, heals, magic, market, might, scrambling, toppled, traded","Use the reading strategy of retelling to understand text","Compare and Contrast : Compare and contrast within and across stories","Long Vowels : Discriminate long \/e\/ vowel digraphs","Adjectives : Identify and use adjectives","Colloquial phrases : Recognize colloquial phrases","Promote higher-order thinking for small groups <br>or whole class"],"pdfs":["pdfsite\/worksheets\/m\/raz_lm26_jackstale_wksh.pdf","pdfsite\/worksheets\/m\/raz_lm26_jackstale_wksh_rc.pdf","pdfsite\/worksheets\/m\/raz_lm26_jackstale_wksh_ph.pdf","pdfsite\/worksheets\/m\/raz_lm26_jackstale_wksh_gm.pdf","pdfsite\/discussion\/m\/raz_dclm26_jackstale.pdf","pdfsite\/comp_quiz\/m\/raz_cqlm26_jackstale.pdf"],"mis":{"clr":"pdfs\/levels\/m\/raz_lm26_jackstale_clr_ds.pdf","lblp":"pdfsite\/lesson_plans\/m\/raz_lm26_jackstale_lp.pdf"}}

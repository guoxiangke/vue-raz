Pecos Bill was an extremely strong boy who was accidentally separated from his parents at a young age. He was found and raised by coyotes in the wild, where he lived for fifteen years. Eventually, a cowboy found him and brought him to civilization, where Bill outsmarted outlaws from the Wild West and tamed the wildest of horses. But that was nothing compared to the adventure during which he lassoed a twisting tornado and rode it like a wild bronco!","count":17,"from":1,"meta":["bronco, bucked, dreaded, embers, lasso, outlaws, pioneer, romped, tyke","Use the reading strategy of visualizing to understand text","Reality and Fantasy : Distinguish between reality and fantasy","Long Vowels : Identify and discriminate the long \/o\/ vowel sound","Apostrophes : Recognize and use apostrophes","Compound Words : Identify and create compound words","Promote higher-order thinking for small groups <br>or whole class"],"pdfs":["pdfsite\/worksheets\/o\/raz_lo24_pecosbillridestornado_wksh.pdf","pdfsite\/worksheets\/o\/raz_lo24_pecosbillridestornado_wksh_rs.pdf","pdfsite\/worksheets\/o\/raz_lo24_pecosbillridestornado_wksh_rc.pdf","pdfsite\/worksheets\/o\/raz_lo24_pecosbillridestornado_wksh_gm.pdf","pdfsite\/worksheets\/o\/raz_lo24_pecosbillridestornado_wksh_ww.pdf","pdfsite\/discussion\/o\/raz_dclo24_pecosbillridestornado.pdf","pdfsite\/comp_quiz\/o\/raz_cqlo24_pecosbillridestornado.pdf"],"mis":{"clr":"pdfsite\/levels\/o_ds\/raz_lo24_pecosbillridestornado_clr_ds.pdf","lblp":"pdfsite\/lesson_plans\/o\/raz_lo24_pecosbillridestornado_lp.pdf"}}

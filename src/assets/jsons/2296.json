These mythical creatures may not exist, but animal hybrids do! Both nature-made and human-made hybrids are fascinating animals. While some would argue that hybrid animals are a threat to at-risk species, others claim that they are nature's way of speeding up the adaptation process. Students will enjoy the detailed text and the supporting text features.

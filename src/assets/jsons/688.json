His older brother has told him all about what fishing with Grandpa is like, so he is very excited and nervous all at once. Devon listens carefully to Grandpa's instructions and helps him maneuver the canoe down the river. The afternoon is peaceful and the wildlife beautiful--he only hopes the stories of snakes and 'gators aren't true!

These mythical creatures may not exist, but animal hybrids do! Both nature-made and human-made hybrids are fascinating animals. While some would argue that hybrid animals are a threat to at-risk species, others claim that they are nature's way of speeding up the adaptation process. Students will enjoy the detailed text and the supporting text features. The book and lesson are also available for levels Z and Z1.","count":26,"from":0,"meta":["biodiversity, chromosomes, diverged, DNA, embryos, expediting, fertilize, genetic, hybrids, interbreeding, meiosis, offspring, reproduce, species, sterile, susceptible, test tube, transgenic","Summarize to understand text","Compare and Contrast : Compare and contrast","Dash : Recognize and use dashes","Synonyms and Antonyms : Identify synonyms and antonyms","Promote higher-order thinking for small groups <br>or whole class"],"pdfs":["pdfsite\/2296\/raz_lz208_hybridanimals_wksh.pdf","pdfsite\/2296\/raz_lz208_hybridanimals_wksh_rc.pdf","pdfsite\/2296\/raz_lz208_hybridanimals_wksh_gm.pdf","pdfsite\/2296\/raz_lz208_hybridanimals_wksh_ww.pdf","pdfsite\/discussion\/z2\/raz_dclz208_hybridanimals.pdf","pdfsite\/comp_quiz\/z2\/raz_cqlz208_hybridanimals.pdf"],"mis":{"clr":"pdfs\/levels\/z2\/raz_lz208_hybridanimals_clr_ds.pdf","lblp":"pdfsite\/2296\/raz_lz208_hybridanimals_lblp.pdf"}}

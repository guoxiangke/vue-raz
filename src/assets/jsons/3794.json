The founders knew that, throughout history, heads of state often had advisors to help them lead. The Constitution, ratified in 1788, adapted that idea. It allowed the creation of executive departments headed by expert advisors called secretaries. These advisors form what is known as the president's cabinet. They help the president make sure the country's systems work well for its citizens. As the nation has grown, so has the size of presidential cabinets. Over time, the original departments and offices have changed and multiplied. More and more experts have been appointed to help presidents run the country. Modern presidential cabinets include an array of departments, each with specific responsibilities. This book talks about some of the most highly visible cabinets and their responsibilities.","pageCount":18,"highFrequencyWords":"Use of vocabulary lessons requires a subscription to VocabularyA-Z.com.","reviewWords":"","comprehension":"","awareness":"","phonics":"","grammar":"","wordWork":"","pdfName":"raz_lz117_usgovernmentatwork"}

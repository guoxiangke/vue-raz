The king sends out a proclamation stating that he is looking for someone to solve the problem of their decaying land. Whoever can solve the problem will be invited to live in the castle for the rest of his or her days. Ricardo, Roger, and Randy each has useful ideas and brings them to the king: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. The king accepts them all together and names it the Three-R Plan. Improvements are soon witnessed in the land, and the kingdom begins to flourish once again.

She explains that there are many different animals to choose from at a shelter and that they are often healthier than pets that are sold by a breeder or pet store. The book includes information about veterinarians and adoption counselors, and the fees that are collected upon adoption at a shelter are explained. A persuasive last point is made: every time someone adopts from a shelter, he or she saves an animal's life.","pageCount":17,"highFrequencyWords":"breeders, counselors, lifestyle, microchip, obedience training, owner, purebred, shelter, veterinarian","reviewWords":"Use of vocabulary lessons requires a subscription to VocabularyA-Z.com.","comprehension":"Consonant Digraphs                : Recognize and read consonant digraphs sh and ch","awareness":"Conjunctions                : Identify subordinating conjunctions","phonics":"Homographs                : Locate and understand homographs","grammar":"Promote higher-order thinking for small groups <br>or whole class","wordWork":"","pdfName":"raz_lp36_shelterpetsarebest"}

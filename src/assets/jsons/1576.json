The book includes information on solutions that have been adopted in different parts of North America. A persuasive point is made: although these animal crossings are expensive, the number of lives saved-both of humans and other animals-makes the crossings worth the cost. Will you agree or disagree? Photographs and a chart support the text.","pageCount":17,"highFrequencyWords":"collisions, endangered, extinction, habitats, mate, migrate, roam, species, vehicles","reviewWords":"Use of vocabulary lessons requires a subscription to VocabularyA-Z.com.","comprehension":"Open Vowels                : Identify open vowel <i>y<\/i>","awareness":"Adjectives                : Recognize adjectives and the nouns they describe","phonics":"Alphabetical Order                : Arrange words in alphabetical order","grammar":"Promote higher-order thinking for small groups <br>or whole class","wordWork":"","pdfName":"raz_ln31_crittercrossings"}

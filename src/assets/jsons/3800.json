The product of spirited debate by the founders during the Constitutional Convention of 1787, it divides the government into three separate and coequal branches. It describes the powers and responsibilities of each branch: executive, legislative, and judicial. Over the years, Americans have changed the Constitution many times through the amendment process. The first ten amendments, known as the Bill of Rights, protect the rights of all American citizens. The Constitution continues to serve as the backbone of U.S. democracy.","pageCount":18,"highFrequencyWords":"Use of vocabulary lessons requires a subscription to VocabularyA-Z.com.","reviewWords":"","comprehension":"","awareness":"","phonics":"","grammar":"","wordWork":"","pdfName":"raz_lz117_usconstitution"}

The book includes information on solutions that have been adopted in different parts of North America. A persuasive point is made: although these animal crossings are expensive, the number of lives saved-both of humans and other animals-makes the crossings worth the cost. Will you agree or disagree? Photographs and a chart support the text.","count":17,"from":1,"meta":["collisions, endangered, extinction, habitats, mate, migrate, roam, species, vehicles","Use the reading strategy of visualizing to understand text","Problem and Solution : Problem and solution","Open Vowels : Identify open vowel <i>y<\/i>","Adjectives : Recognize adjectives and the nouns they describe","Alphabetical Order : Arrange words in alphabetical order","Promote higher-order thinking for small groups <br>or whole class"],"pdfs":["pdfsite\/worksheets\/n\/raz_ln31_crittercrossings_wksh.pdf","pdfsite\/worksheets\/n\/raz_ln31_crittercrossings_wksh_rs.pdf","pdfsite\/worksheets\/n\/raz_ln31_crittercrossings_wksh_rc.pdf","pdfsite\/worksheets\/n\/raz_ln31_crittercrossings_wksh_gm.pdf","pdfsite\/worksheets\/n\/raz_ln31_crittercrossings_wksh_ww.pdf","pdfsite\/discussion\/n\/raz_dcln31_crittercrossings.pdf","pdfsite\/comp_quiz\/n\/raz_cqln31_crittercrossings.pdf"],"mis":{"clr":"pdfs\/levels\/n\/raz_ln31_crittercrossings_clr_ds.pdf","lblp":"pdfsite\/lesson_plans\/n\/raz_ln31_crittercrossings_lp.pdf"}}

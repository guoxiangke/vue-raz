He eventually comes to a great river and spies a water rat emerging from his home. The two animals strike up a friendship as Rat describes life along the river and teaches Mole about the Wild Wood and Wide World. Rat provides a lavish picnic lunch, introduces Mole to Otter, and discusses Toad and Badger. Later, Mole overturns Rat's boat, for which he is horribly ashamed.

Years of unknowing have fed a hatred and fear of what and who lies on the other side of the wall. When a group of children decide they are tired of living in fear and hatred, a possibility for hope arises. The Wall can also be used to teach students how to make inferences and draw conclusions and to effectively summarize.","count":18,"from":0,"meta":["despise, fluently, hideous, intelligent, invade, kingdoms, paradise, regretted, ruffians","Summarize to understand text","Make Inferences\/Draw Conclusions : Make inferences and draw conclusions","Quotation Marks : Recognize and use quotation marks","Homophones : Identify and use homophones","Promote higher-order thinking for small groups <br>or whole class"],"pdfs":["pdfsite\/691\/raz_ls36_wall_wksh.pdf","pdfsite\/691\/raz_ls36_wall_wksh_rc.pdf","pdfsite\/691\/raz_ls36_wall_wksh_gm.pdf","pdfsite\/691\/raz_ls36_wall_wksh_ww.pdf","pdfsite\/discussion\/s\/raz_dcls36_wall.pdf","pdfsite\/bench_quiz\/s\/raz_bmqls_01_f.pdf"],"mis":{"clr":"pdfs\/levels\/s\/raz_ls36_wall_clr_ds.pdf","lblp":"pdfsite\/691\/raz_ls36_wall_lblp.pdf"}}

The edible mushroom gives Alice the ability to grow or shrink, depending on which side she nibbles. This time, however, her neck stretches to a crazy length, which convinces a pigeon that she is a serpent, not a little girl. This gives her the incentive to eat a different part of the mushroom and shrink back down to an acceptable nine inches high.","pageCount":18,"highFrequencyWords":"Use of vocabulary lessons requires a subscription to VocabularyA-Z.com.","reviewWords":"Use the reading strategy of retelling to understand the story","comprehension":"Similes and Metaphors                : Identify and understand similes and metaphors","awareness":"","phonics":"","grammar":"","wordWork":"","pdfName":"raz_ly24_alicesadventuresinwonderlandpart3"}

The story begins when a travel-weary old man shares the secret of fire with a group of hunter birds. The birds then set out to steal the fire from the cockatoo who hoards it. The tale explains both the origins of useful fire and the brush fires that periodically sweep the grasslands of the Australian outback. Whimsical illustrations support the text.","count":25,"from":1,"meta":["ancient, bushes, cockatoo, corroboree, culture, elders, enraged, feat, ingenuity, journey, journeyed, kookaburra, refreshed, robin, traditions, wren","Retell while reading to understand text","Story Elements : Identify characters, setting, and plot","Quotation Marks : Identify and use quotation marks","Content Vocabulary : Understand and use content vocabulary","Promote higher-order thinking for small groups <br>or whole class"],"pdfs":["pdfsite\/nonbooks\/literature_circle_custom_journals\/how_the_robin_stole_fire.pdf","pdfsite\/nonbooks\/common_core_supplement\/how_the_robin_stole_fire_ccss_lp.pdf","pdfs\/worksheets\/r\/raz_lr05_robinstole_wksh.pdf","pdfsite\/156\/raz_lr05_robinfire_wksh_rc.pdf","pdfsite\/156\/raz_lr05_robinfire_wksh_gm.pdf","pdfsite\/156\/raz_lr05_robinfire_wksh_ww.pdf","pdfsite\/discussion\/r\/raz_lr05_robinfire_dc.pdf","pdfsite\/comp_quiz\/r\/raz_cqlr05_robinfire.pdf"],"mis":{"clr":"pdfs\/levels\/r\/raz_lr05_robinfire_clr_ds.pdf","lblp":"pdfsite\/lesson_plans\/r\/raz_lr05_robinfire_lp.pdf"}}

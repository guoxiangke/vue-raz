Along the way, the ship runs aground on a coral reef. If not for the imaginative thinking of one of the crew, all might have perished. Instead, the ship was kept afloat until Captain James Cook found a safe harbor where repairs could be made. Told in first-person narrative, The Reef is a suspenseful, engaging story.","count":23,"from":1,"meta":["ashore, esteemed, lieutenant, naturalist, poisonous, rigging, salvage, superstitious, survey","Visualize events and characters in order to understand text","Analyze Plot : Identify and analyze the parts of a plot","Prepositional Phrases : Identify and use prepositional phrases","Synonyms : Identify and use synonyms","Promote higher-order thinking for small groups <br>or whole class"],"pdfs":["pdfsite\/nonbooks\/literature_circle_custom_journals\/the_reef.pdf","pdfs\/worksheets\/x\/raz_lx01_thereef_wksh.pdf","pdfsite\/worksheets\/x\/raz_lx01_thereef_wksh_rc.pdf","pdfsite\/worksheets\/x\/raz_lx01_thereef_wksh_gm.pdf","pdfsite\/worksheets\/x\/raz_lx01_thereef_wksh_ww.pdf","pdfsite\/discussion\/x\/raz_lx01_thereef_dc.pdf","pdfsite\/comp_quiz\/x\/raz_cqlx01_thereef.pdf"],"mis":{"clr":"pdfs\/levels\/x\/raz_lx01_thereef_clr_ds.pdf","lblp":"pdfsite\/lesson_plans\/x\/raz_lx01_thereef_lp.pdf"}}

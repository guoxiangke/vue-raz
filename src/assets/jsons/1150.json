Exploring in the woods, they discovered a large hole in the ground and excitedly dug to investigate. They continued to explore the cave until they discovered a dark, cavernous room. The walls were covered with paintings of animals-found later to be created by Stone Age people who lived 17,000 years earlier. Archaeologists began to raise many questions, some of which are still unanswered. Photographs, a map, and illustrations support the text.","count":25,"from":1,"meta":["accustomed, analyzed, bas-relief, befuddled, cavernous, discovery, exploration, instincts, masterpieces, methods, mysterious, mystical, passage, radiocarbon, scaffold, treasures","Use the reading strategy of visualizing to understand text","Problem and Solution : Analyze problem and solution","Commas : Identify and use commas after introductory words","Conjunctions : Understand the use of conjunctions in the text","Promote higher-order thinking for small groups <br>or whole class"],"pdfs":["pdfs\/worksheets\/s\/raz_ls26_whatboysfound_wksh.pdf","pdfsite\/worksheets\/s\/raz_ls26_whatboysfound_wksh_rs.pdf","pdfsite\/worksheets\/s\/raz_ls26_whatboysfound_wksh_rc.pdf","pdfsite\/worksheets\/s\/raz_ls26_whatboysfound_wksh_gm.pdf","pdfsite\/worksheets\/s\/raz_ls26_whatboysfound_wksh_ww.pdf","pdfsite\/discussion\/s\/raz_dcls26_whatboysfound.pdf","pdfsite\/comp_quiz\/s\/raz_cqls26_whatboysfound.pdf"],"mis":{"clr":"pdfs\/levels\/s\/raz_ls26_whatboysfound_clr_ds.pdf","lblp":"pdfsite\/lesson_plans\/s\/raz_ls26_whatboysfound_lp.pdf"}}

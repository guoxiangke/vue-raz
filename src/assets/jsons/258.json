Readers will see photographs of the great auk, which has become extinct, and other birds, such as the kakapo and California condor, which are being bred and protected because their numbers are so few. Readers are gently reminded that human activity is the reason most birds are endangered; yet humans are the ones working to save the birds from extinction.","count":17,"from":1,"meta":["albatross, breeding, California, condor, endangered, extinct, great auk, kakapo, predators","Use the reading strategy of asking and answering questions","Author's Purpose : Identify author's purpose","Vowel Digraphs : Understand that the <em>ea<\/em> digraph can stand for different vowel sounds","Sentence Fragments : Recognize naming part of sentence (subject)","Often Confused Words : Understand and use often-confused words","Promote higher-order thinking for small groups <br>or whole class"],"pdfs":["pdfsite\/nonbooks\/common_core_supplement\/endangered_birds_ccss_lp.pdf","pdfs\/worksheets\/m\/raz_lm12_endangered_wksh.pdf","pdfsite\/worksheets\/m\/raz_lm12_endangeredbirds_wksh_rc.pdf","pdfsite\/worksheets\/m\/raz_lm12_endangeredbirds_wksh_gm.pdf","pdfsite\/worksheets\/m\/raz_lm12_endangeredbirds_wksh_ww.pdf","pdfsite\/discussion\/m\/raz_lm12_endangeredbirds_dc.pdf","pdfsite\/comp_quiz\/m\/raz_cqlm12_endangeredbirds.pdf"],"mis":{"clr":"pdfs\/levels\/m\/raz_lm12_endangeredbirds_clr_ds.pdf","lblp":"pdfsite\/lesson_plans\/m\/raz_lm12_endangeredbirds_lp.pdf"}}

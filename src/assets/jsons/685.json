Because he is small for his age, Shaq is always picked last and seems to spend more time in the nurse's office than playing games. After a conversation with the nurse, however, Shaq's world is turned around as she point out his strength on the court. Speedier than a Meteor is a delightful story about the underdog and can be used to teach students how to identify narrative point of view and accurately retell a story.","pageCount":18,"highFrequencyWords":"advantage, court, dribble, flu, forfeit, meteor, pronounce, season, shoot","reviewWords":"Use of vocabulary lessons requires a subscription to VocabularyA-Z.com.","comprehension":"Dash                : Recognize and use dashes","awareness":"Alphabetical Order                : Place words in alphabetical order","phonics":"Promote higher-order thinking for small groups <br>or whole class","grammar":"","wordWork":"","pdfName":"raz_lp36_speedierthanmeteor"}

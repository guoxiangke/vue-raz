Because he is small for his age, Shaq is always picked last and seems to spend more time in the nurse's office than playing games. After a conversation with the nurse, however, Shaq's world is turned around as she point out his strength on the court. Speedier than a Meteor is a delightful story about the underdog and can be used to teach students how to identify narrative point of view and accurately retell a story.","count":18,"from":0,"meta":["advantage, court, dribble, flu, forfeit, meteor, pronounce, season, shoot","Retell to understand text","Narrative Point of View : Identify narrative point of view","Dash : Recognize and use dashes","Alphabetical Order : Place words in alphabetical order","Promote higher-order thinking for small groups <br>or whole class"],"pdfs":["pdfsite\/685\/raz_lp36_speedierthanmeteor_wksh.pdf","pdfsite\/685\/raz_lp36_speedierthanmeteor_wksh_rc.pdf","pdfsite\/685\/raz_lp36_speedierthanmeteor_wksh_gm.pdf","pdfsite\/685\/raz_lp36_speedierthanmeteor_wksh_ww.pdf","pdfsite\/discussion\/p\/raz_dclp36_speedierthanmeteor.pdf","pdfsite\/bench_quiz\/p\/raz_bmqlp_00_f.pdf"],"mis":{"clr":"pdfs\/levels\/p\/raz_lp36_speedierthanmeteor_clr_ds.pdf","lblp":"pdfsite\/685\/raz_lp36_speedierthanmeteor_lblp.pdf"}}
